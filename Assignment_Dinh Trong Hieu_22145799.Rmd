# ASSIGNMENT 1 CODE TRANSCRIPTION & EXPLAINATION

## Task 1:

```{R}
#Loading in neccessary Library
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

#TASK 1: 
#Data Input as well as replacing "?" appearance with "NA"

engine = read.csv("Engine.csv", na.strings = "?")
automobile = read.csv("Automobile.csv", na.strings = "?")
maintenance = read.csv("Maintenance.csv", na.strings = "?" )

#List out the all of the loaded column and double check the data type 
    str(engine)
      
    str(automobile)
      
    str(maintenance)
  
#Convert the catergorical variable as factors with dedicated levels
engine$FuelTypes = factor(engine$FuelTypes,
                          levels = c("diesel","gas"))

automobile$BodyStyles = factor(automobile$BodyStyles, 
                          levels = c("hardtop","wagon","sedan", "hatchback", "convertible") )

maintenance$ErrorCodes = factor(maintenance$ErrorCodes,
                        levels = c(1,0,-1),
                        labels = c("engine fails", "no error", "other vehicle component fails")
                                )


#Replacing the missing values in the column Horsepower with the mean of horsepower
mean_hp = mean(engine$Horsepower, na.rm = TRUE)
engine$Horsepower[is.na(engine$Horsepower)] = mean_hp

#illustrating the horsepower distribution through histogram: 

ggplot(engine, aes(x = Horsepower)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 15, fill = "orange", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Horsepower Distribution", x = "Horsepower", y = "Count")
```

## Task 2:

```{R}
#Task 2 
#Analyze the distribution of horsepower across the number of cylinders with Histogram - faucet wrap type of illustration 

ggplot(engine, aes(x = Horsepower)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 10, fill = "green", color = "black") +
  facet_wrap(~ NumCylinders) +
  labs(title = "Horsepower Distribution by Number of Cylinders", x = "Horsepower", y = "Count")


#Distribution of the horsepower across the groups of the engine sizes with Histogram - faucet wrap type of illustration
engine$EngineSize <- cut(engine$EngineSize,
                               breaks = c(0,60, 100, 200, 300, Inf),
                               labels = c("0-59","60-100", "101-200", "201-300", "301+"),
                                right = TRUE, include.lowest = TRUE)
engine$EngineSize <- factor(engine$EngineSize, 
                                      levels = c("0-59","60-100", "101-200", "201-300", "301+"),
                                      ordered = TRUE)
# Visualize horsepower distribution by engine size groups using facet wrap.
ggplot(engine, aes(x = Horsepower)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 10, fill = "blue", color = "black") +
  facet_wrap(~ EngineSize) +
  labs(title = "Horsepower Distribution by Engine Size Groups", x = "Horsepower", y = "Count")

```

#### Comments on the Findings of the Horsepower Distribution by Number of Cylinders by Histogram:

It could be seen that the variable of Four & Six Cylinders have the
highest number counts, substantially higher than others. Furthermore, we
can see a trend that the more cylinders that the engine have, the more
horsepower that the engine can produce. Only when reaching the highest
specs of high-performance vehicles (V8 and V12), there are the exception
of a eight cylinders can beat the twelve cylinders

#### Comments on the Findings of the Horsepower Distribution by Engine Size Groups by Historgram:

Based on the engine sizes group distribution, we can see that most of
the engine will have the engine size in the group of over 60 – under
200. Same thing can be seen just like on the horsepower distribution
based on the number of cylinders, this histogram pointed out that the
bigger the engine size of the vehicle is, it will likely produce bigger
horsepower. This is understandable as most of the popular and more
budget-friendly brand like “Mazda, Honda, Subaru, Mitsubishi, Chevrolet”
are producing their vehicle in this range to prioritize efficiency and
to make the car more affordable compared to those more luxury / high
performance segment like “Porsche, Mercedes, Audi, BMW”. This current
dataset suggested that the current customers of the center are being the
mix of middle income (with the more budget-friendly/ family car) and
both luxury vehicles, which the current lower-budget segment dominates.
With that being said, the Maintenance Center should be based on these
insights to have suitable strategic plans / promotion to promote the
center to further attract the higher-end (special promotion, all rounded
services for luxury cars) and keeping the current main segment develop
(by promoting the quality services, authentic components...)

## Task 3:

```{R}
#Task 3
#Filter list to define top 5 most common troubles related 

# Merge Maintenance with Automobile data  using the key 'PlateNumber'
maint_auto <- merge(automobile, maintenance, by = "PlateNumber")

# Merge the combined data with Engines data using the key 'EngineModel'
maint_auto_engine <- merge(maint_auto, engine, by = "EngineModel")

# Filter records that report a trouble (which indicates by number "1" or "-1" in the original dataset)
trouble_records <- maint_auto_engine %>% 
  filter(ErrorCodes %in% c("engine fails","other vehicle component fails"))

# For diesel engines: Filter out to select the diesel type of engine then sort out the top 5 with the highest count rates (n)
top5_diesel <- trouble_records %>% 
  filter(ErrorCodes == "engine fails") %>% 
  filter(FuelTypes == "diesel") %>%
  count(Troubles, sort = TRUE) %>%
  slice_head(n = 5)
  
# For gas engines: Filter out to select the gas type of engine then sort out the top 5 with the highest count rates (n)
top5_gas <- trouble_records %>%
  filter(ErrorCodes == "engine fails") %>%
  filter(FuelTypes == "gas") %>%
  count(Troubles, sort = TRUE) %>%
  slice_head(n = 5)

# Display the results in tables
print("Top 5 Troubles for Diesel Engines:")
print(top5_diesel)

print("Top 5 Troubles for Gas Engines:")
print(top5_gas)
```

#### Comments on the Findings:

Looking at the result table of top 5 Troubles the diesel and gas
variation both have the Cylinders Trouble in the top 5. This clearly
shows that the Cylinder can be considered as the vulnerable part of the
engine that can get into problems. Furthermore, we can see a substantial
difference between the numbers of diesel and gas engines, pointing out
that diesel engines are more durable and have a higher error-free rate.
Furthermore, when looking at the distribution rate of gas and diesel,
there are much more gas engine type than the diesel engine type. One
final notable part is that in the top 2 and top 3 out of the top 5
highest troubles for Gas Engines are still in the finding stage, point
out that there is the potential that gas engine might be harder to
determine the errors  when there is the suspect about errors on the
vehicle.

## Task 4:

```{R}
#Task 4:
# Filter the merged dataset for vehicles with reported troubles.
trouble_vehicles <- maint_auto_engine %>% 
  filter(ErrorCodes %in% c("engine fails","other vehicle component fails"))

#The two selected factors are: FuelTypes and BodyStyles
# --- Factor 1: FuelTypes ---

# Establish a table between Maintenance Methods by FuelTypes
fuel_factor <- table(trouble_vehicles$Methods, trouble_vehicles$FuelTypes)
cat("Table: Maintenance Methods vs FuelTypes")
print(fuel_factor)

# Visualize the relationship with a bar plot.
ggplot(trouble_vehicles, aes(x = FuelTypes, fill = Methods)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Maintenance Methods by FuelTypes", x = "FuelTypes", y = "Count")

# --- Factor 2: BodyStyles ---

# Establish a table between Maintenance Methods by BodyStyles
body_factor <- table(trouble_vehicles$Methods, trouble_vehicles$BodyStyles)
cat("Table: Maintenance Methods vs BodyStyles")
print(body_factor)

# Visualize the relationship with a bar plot.
ggplot(trouble_vehicles, aes(x = BodyStyles, fill = Methods)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Maintenance Methods by BodyStyles", x = "BodyStyles", y = "Count")

```

#### Comments on the Findings of the Maintenance Methods counts by Fuel Type Factor:

As expected, the results for maintenance for Gas Engines are
significantly higher in terms of numbers and urgent. Only gasoline
engines need to be urgently fixed due to vital problems, while none were
reported from the diesel engines. Also, the charts pointed out that the
replacement for any engine is higher than those that just need to adjust
only. Combining with the needs of urgent care for gasoline vehicles,
this data suggested that the maintenance center should always prepare
the components part ready to stock preparation for replacement scenarios
or the need of urgent care. 

#### Comments on the Findings of the Maintenance Methods counts by Fuel Type Factor:

The same key insights pointed out that all of the body styles vehicle
have reported that the replacement rate is much higher than the vehicles
that just need adjustment only. Also, 4 out of 5 body styles have been
reported to have urgent care cases (except Convertible), so in stocks
components for any body styles are vital for the maintenance center.
Noticeably, the sedan and hatchback dominate the other body styles,
further suggesting the center should further concentrate develop the
process / suitable human resource training to sedan and hatchback body
styles, while keeping the suitable investment for other body styles as
well.
